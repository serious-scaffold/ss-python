Setting up a project often involves more than just establishing a basic project structure. It involves tasks like integrating GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD, configuring lint, test and documentation, as well as implementing settings, logging and other frequently used modules. [Serious Scaffold Python](https://github.com/serious-scaffold/serious-scaffold-python) streamlines this process. Powered by [`copier`](https://copier.readthedocs.io/), bootstrapping a new Python project can be done with a single command. By answering a few questions, the project will be fully configured and ready for development. Furthermore, the project can be updated alongside the advancement of the template.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Certain system-level Python applications are needed and it is recommended to use [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install and run them in isolated environments. Refer to pipx's installation instructions [here](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/). Once `pipx` is set up, install the necessary tools using the following commands.

```bash
# Copier: Template rendering for projects.
pipx install copier
# Pipenv: Virtual environment and package manager for Python.
pipx install pipenv
# Pre-commit: Automates Git hooks for code quality checks.
pipx install pre-commit
```

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Generate the project.

   ```bash
   copier copy gh:serious-scaffold/serious-scaffold-python /path/to/project
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and initialize a git repository.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   git init
   ```

3. Set up the development environment.

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

4. Commit the initialized project.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize from serious-scaffold-python."
   ```

5. That's it! Feel free to focus on the coding within `src` folder.

## 🛡 Badge

Badge for markdown:

```markdown
{{ logo_badge() }}
```

Badge for restructuredtext:

```restructuredtext
.. image:: {{ logo_badge_url() }}
    :target: {{ page_url() }}
```

It will looks like this: {{ logo_badge() }}
