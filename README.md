## üîß Prerequisites

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) is required to manage the standalone tools used across the development lifecycle.
Please refer to pipx's installation instructions [here](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
Once pipx is set up, install the copier for project generation using the following command:

```bash
pipx install copier==9.4.1
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. Generate the project.

   ```bash
   copier copy gh:serious-scaffold/ss-python /path/to/project
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory and initialize a git repository.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   git init
   ```

1. Install standalone tools.

   ```bash
   make prerequisites
   ```

1. Set up the development environment.

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

1. Commit the initialized project.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize from serious-scaffold."
   ```

1. That's it! Feel free to focus on the coding within `src` folder.
